00:00:00,774 --> 00:00:05,101
Welcome back. I'm Jeffrey Brown of the PBS news hour and you are watching

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:10,427
PBS Books here at the Miami Book Fair in partnership with the Great American Read.

3
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:12,776
I'm joined now by Janet Fitch

4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:17,528
But to talk about her new novel "The Revolution of Marina M."
Welcome to you.

5
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:18,297
Thank you.

6
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:20,207
The russian revolution. Huh?

7
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:22,182
What got you into that?

8
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:26,825
Well, I was history major. Russia was my field...

9
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:28,357
It was. Years goes back.

10
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:31,822
I took russian in highschool. I took russian in college.

11
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:35,209
I'm one of those people obsessed with russian literature

12
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:38,559
so it was sooner or later there would be a russian novel.

13
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,063
How much... so how much did you know of that period?

14
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:44,701
I had a pretty good grounding, but ...

15
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:49,808
when you're writing about people in history, it's different than writing history.

16
00:00:49,903 --> 00:00:53,336
You have to have a pretty good grounding in what happen, but ...

17
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:56,362
it's more the texture of life you have to know

18
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,747
What do the phone... how do the phone work in 1916 ?

19
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:06,891
And how did the bread russian system work and what do the bread card look like?

20
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:09,095
So the devil's in the details.

21
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:13,763
So you had to know about these things and then decide how to use them in fiction.

22
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,021
Well, I tend to research and write in tandem.

23
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,378
Yeah

24
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,761
So I don't get too far down the rabbit hole ...

25
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:29,493
So... yeah! I... I found out what I need to know to work... to write that scene or that chapter.

26
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:36,199
So tell... so tell us about this book... well tho... this main character Marina.

27
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:37,673
Where did she come from?
(Who is she?)

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,720
Marina... is a ...

29
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:46,259
sixteen when the book opens during World War I, 1916

30
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:51,348
because Revolutions don't happen... you know by themselves. There's reasons.

31
00:01:51,841 --> 00:02:01,864
It's World War I was a terrific disaster for Russia and for the... for tsar.

32
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:08,261
And she's a privileged girl. She's the daughter of intellectuals.

33
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:11,032
And she champions the revolution.

34
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:16,589
And when.. the Bolsheviks come into power in october...

35
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,700
her family comes apart — it's a liberal family not a radical family.

36
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:25,715
And she lives the life of the revolution.

37
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,060
She is a poet.

38
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:31,425
And I had begun the book as a novel inverse

39
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,184
You did?

40
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:32,752
Yeah!

41
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:34,923
For seventeen chapters ... in verse (reverse)

42
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:35,357
Wow!

43
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:35,957
And then...

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,137
Did you ever do that bevore?

45
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:37,959
No.

46
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,492
Because she's a poet, I thought her book should be a poetry, but...

47
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:46,843
the first I got to a place where I needed my fiction writer tools

48
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,277
to know what happen(ed) and then I was writing fictions.

49
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:55,648
So... so you hit on her as your main character and then... in research

50
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,974
I mean she based on any pret... any real person.

51
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:04,125
No. I had written a short story with the character in America as an émigré

52
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:08,344
And I never forgot about her.

53
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:11,749
And I returned to write... I wrote a short story about her.

54
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:14,998
And then I tried to write a nover about her in America.

55
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:18,590
And there were just too many things I didn't know about her.

56
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:23,710
So before I knew it, I was writing a story set during the Russian Revolution.

57
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:26,173
So well how far back where you're writing about her?

58
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,201
I mean, this... this initial short story.

59
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,182
It goes back to twenty...
(Is this year ago?)

60
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:35,937
This was between "White Oleander" and "Paint it Black"

61
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,695
I had a nover that failed.

62
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:41,130
But there was this character I love so after...

63
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:47,027
after "Paint it Black" came out I decided to write that short story.

64
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:50,648
And I just wanted... I wanted to be with her more.

65
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:56,140
That's inte... I maen people wonder where these... where these things come from. Right?

66
00:03:56,813 --> 00:04:02,849
So this all... This is a big book, but it started with one character that.. from... that you thought of something else.

67
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:05,244
Right. Not even in this time and place.

68
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,762
yeah

69
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:07,967
You...

70
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:09,469
And she's very different...

71
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:16,578
You know it's again... It's a story about how young woman builds herself

72
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:22,372
through events and through reactions to things, decisions that she's made.

73
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:28,183
You know girl makes a decision in... at sixteen and she's... she has to live through it

74
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:31,188
and the woman becomes the result of that.

75
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:38,444
But unlike my two earlier books, I have character Sue (are) full of self-doubt.

76
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:38,950
mm-hmm

77
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:43,744
Whereas now I have a character who is absolutely confident.

78
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:46,232
And I've never had anybody like that.

79
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,157
I... I'm full of self-doubt.

80
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:52,016
I'm not used to be with somebody who knows what she thinks.

81
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:57,501
She can be totally wrong, things could go horribly astray as they do,

82
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:58,574
but it was f...

83
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:03,432
She's a more of a heroine type of character, that I've ever worked with before.

84
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:06,791
So what did that mean for the writing? Did she tell you what was gonna happen next?

85
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:07,796
They always do.

86
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:08,475
They do?

87
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,220
They always do. You just have to stay really close to the heartbeat of the character.

88
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:18,885
It's almost like leaning your head against her chest and hearing... hearing the heartbeat.

89
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:26,821
Of course in this case it's her story it's a young woman (coming away), but it's against some very big history

90
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:27,207
Right.

91
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,945
So it's the kind of things that happened to her are... it's not like what happened to most of... most young people.

92
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:37,445
Uh well, .. we all live in history.

93
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:42,073
You know very few people actually at the top making decisions.

94
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:49,567
Most of us are living where... we see the shadow on the wall, we care a rumor, we read the newpaper and

95
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:53,687
how people live in history realy interests me. And especially now.

96
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:54,979
Now it's...

97
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:59,911
When I was writing the book it was about the character — now it's me.

98
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:02,613
You know you get a strong sense of what that's like.

99
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:03,018
Yeah.

100
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:09,203
The blurb you're on the cover says: Marina is a female Zhivago.

101
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:16,691
So... I mean you can't read something like... book like this about the Russian Revolution without thinking of these models. Right?

102
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,289
Like a doctor Zhivogo.

103
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,508
Did  you know... did you have these models in mind?

104
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:27,249
Well. It's all goes into the pot. You know it's a big gumbo.

105
00:06:27,324 --> 00:06:30,170
And it's russian literature

106
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:38,697
It's... I mean I encountered Zhivago far earlier than... than Pasternak's novel.

107
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:42,214
I encountered it on the sc... on the widescreen

108
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:42,867
Of course. Yeah.

109
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:46,764
In the little train going across the big snowy expanse

110
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:51,076
on the forty foot high faces Zhivago and Lara

111
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,460
I mean that brands you forever

112
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:54,906
Yeah.

113
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,957
What about russian literature, russian-write novelists?

114
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:01,282
Uh well I... I fell in love with russian literature.

115
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:04,159
I'm one of those people who is obsessed with russian literature.

116
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,488
And I encountered...

117
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:11,584
I encountered it for the first time as a junior high kid.

118
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:16,996
I was reading some... In English class that give you some treacly (trickly) female...

119
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:20,898
It was you know (crest) (cross) delehanty. People don't even read that anymore.

120
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:24,063
Cherry Ames, the student nurse, you know.

121
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,128
And it did not appeal to me at all.

122
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,342
I was infuriated. I came home and complained.

123
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,433
And my father gave me "Crime and Punishment".

124
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,392
So here. See you if you like that. And I... I loved it.

125
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,674
I loved it. It was so intense and extreme and...

126
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:45,026
people were you know they bludgeoned the landlady to death with an axe because of the philosophy.

127
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,557
It's like... Yeah! That is...

128
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,948
So I was... you know I was lost. I mean that was it for me

129
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:55,235
I took russian in... in high school. I took russian in college and...

130
00:07:56,282 --> 00:08:00,343
it was only a matter of time before I tried a russian novel.

131
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,451
Do you think of this as a kinda departure for you from your other books

132
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,488
to going back in history and the epic nature of it?

133
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:11,813
Yeah. That... that was the departure

134
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,159
you know the building of woman, is similar.

135
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:23,368
But the actual amount of time and energy to construct a world

136
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:28,517
was something very new. I'm a writer of place. And time is also...

137
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,452
What does that mean? you...

138
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:34,709
You know place is very important. I need to know where things happen. There's a map in the book.

139
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,458
My imagi... That's how my imagination works. It's very geographical.

140
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:46,821
And... but time is also a place. The past is a country as well.

141
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:51,786
So it's constructing the world that I have to...

142
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:56,302
you know I have to... I... I'm from LA. I was able to do it with first two novels (to do the first)

143
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,702
with a foundation anyway of place.

144
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:04,252
But Petersburg... I was a student there in 1977

145
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:10,812
so I knew it somewhat, but I had to learn it the way someone who lived there, who grew up there and knew it.

146
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,731
And you did that through books...

147
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:16,728
I did it through reading. I went to Russia couple times. I'd also been a student there so you know for the memory

148
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:20,034
I'd also been a student there so you know for the memory...

149
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:24,778
I read a lot of women's memoirs so things that weren't intended for publication,

150
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,930
but just women talk thinking about their lives. Very valuable.

151
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:34,118
You haven't you are telling me before we started... I was commenting on that cover

152
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,377
And you were said that you got... you got involved in the details of the cover.

153
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:44,119
Yes. And this is something so rare. Publisheres usually don't let the writer interfere,

154
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:48,616
because we're generally not visual people. We're people of the word.

155
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,949
But I needed it to be historical accurate.

156
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:58,549
The hair was not quite 1916-1917

157
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,951
at one point she bobs her hair which people did.

158
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:06,231
But before that the hair was very full and low

159
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:11,256
The hair had to change, I cut her nai... I asked them to cut her nails,

160
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,813
because they didn't have manicures during the Revolution.

161
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:20,458
So yeah, little details. But the overall design was theirs.

162
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:28,882
So... so... I'm curious when you... because it's... it's story of one young woman but in the history

163
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:34,294
It... you there has to be a balance. Right? I mean you have to let us as readers know what's going on in the history.

164
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:34,789
Yes.

165
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:36,668
So how's... where's the balance for you?

166
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:39,655
Is that something you wondered about as you were writing or you read about?

167
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:51,811
Well the balance for me is I know so much more about that history, than I want to subject the reader to.

168
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,883
Because I... I was... history was my field.

169
00:10:55,341 --> 00:11:00,476
So the politics of the Revolution is very intricate

170
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:06,693
and an american without background you can only expect people to digest a certain amount

171
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:14,125
And you really only technically need what people require to understand the scene,

172
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:18,460
to understand what's going on, what's in the air.

173
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:26,064
I had people read it who have trouble following politics — they don't follow history very well.

174
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,903
And I... I thought you know to construct solidly enough that

175
00:11:29,997 --> 00:11:34,584
someone who is not history buff can follow it easily. That's what I wanted.
