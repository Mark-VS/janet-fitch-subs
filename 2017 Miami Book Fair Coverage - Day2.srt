00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:42,351
Welcome back. I'm Jeffrey Brown of the PBS news hour and you are watching

2
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:47,677
PBS Books here at the Miami Book Fair in partnership with the Great American Read.

3
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:50,026
I'm joined now by Janet Fitch

4
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:54,778
But to talk about her new novel "The Revolution of Marina M."
Welcome to you.

5
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:55,547
Thank you.

6
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,457
The russian revolution. Huh?

7
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,432
What got you into that?

8
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:04,075
Well, I was history major. Russia was my field...

9
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:05,607
It was. Years goes back.

10
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:09,072
I took russian in highschool. I took russian in college.

11
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:12,459
I'm one of those people obsessed with russian literature

12
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:15,809
so it was sooner or later there would be a russian novel.

13
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:18,313
How much... so how much did you know of that period?

14
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:21,951
I had a pretty good grounding, but ...

15
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,058
when you're writing about people in history, it's different than writing history.

16
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:30,586
You have to have a pretty good grounding in what happen, but ...

17
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:33,612
it's more the texture of life you have to know

18
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,997
What do the phone... how do the phone work in 1916 ?

19
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:44,141
And how did the bread russian system work and what do the bread card look like?

20
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:46,345
So the devil's in the details.

21
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:51,013
So you had to know about these things and then decide how to use them in fiction.

22
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:54,271
Well, I tend to research and write in tandem.

23
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:54,628
Yeah

24
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:58,011
So I don't get too far down the rabbit hole ...

25
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:06,743
So... yeah! I... I found out what I need to know to work... to write that scene or that chapter.

26
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:13,449
So tell... so tell us about this book... well tho... this main character Marina.

27
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:14,923
Where did she come from?
(Who is she?)

28
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,970
Marina... is a ...

29
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:23,509
sixteen when the book opens during World War I, 1916

30
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:28,598
because Revolutions don't happen... you know by themselves. There's reasons.

31
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:39,114
It's World War I was a terrific disaster for Russia and for the... for tsar.

32
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:45,511
And she's a privileged girl. She's the daughter of intellectuals.

33
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,282
And she champions the revolution.

34
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:53,839
And when.. the Bolsheviks come into power in october...

35
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,950
her family comes apart — it's a liberal family not a radical family.

36
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,965
And she lives the life of the revolution.

37
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,310
She is a poet.

38
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:08,675
And I had begun the book as a novel inverse

39
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:09,434
You did?

40
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:10,002
Yeah!

41
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:12,173
For seventeen chapters ... in verse (reverse)

42
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:12,607
Wow!

43
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:13,207
And then...

44
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,387
Did you ever do that bevore?

45
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:15,209
No.

46
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:18,742
Because she's a poet, I thought her book should be a poetry, but...

47
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:24,093
the first I got to a place where I needed my fiction writer tools

48
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:27,527
to know what happen(ed) and then I was writing fictions.

49
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:32,898
So... so you hit on her as your main character and then... in research

50
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:35,224
I mean she based on any pret... any real person.

51
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:41,375
No. I had written a short story with the character in America as an émigré

52
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:45,594
And I never forgot about her.

53
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,999
And I returned to write... I wrote a short story about her.

54
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:52,248
And then I tried to write a nover about her in America.

55
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:55,840
And there were just too many things I didn't know about her.

56
00:26:55,854 --> 00:27:00,960
So before I knew it, I was writing a story set during the Russian Revolution.

57
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:03,423
So well how far back where you're writing about her?

58
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,451
I mean, this... this initial short story.

59
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:07,432
It goes back to twenty...
(Is this year ago?)

60
00:27:08,472 --> 00:27:13,187
This was between "White Oleander" and "Paint it Black"

61
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,945
I had a nover that failed.

62
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:18,380
But there was this character I love so after...

63
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:24,277
after "Paint it Black" came out I decided to write that short story.

64
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:27,898
And I just wanted... I wanted to be with her more.

65
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:33,390
That's inte... I maen people wonder where these... where these things come from. Right?

66
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:40,099
So this all... This is a big book, but it started with one character that.. from... that you thought of something else.

67
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,494
Right. Not even in this time and place.

68
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,012
yeah

69
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:45,217
You...

70
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:46,719
And she's very different...

71
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:53,828
You know it's again... It's a story about how young woman builds herself

72
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:59,622
through events and through reactions to things, decisions that she's made.

73
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:05,433
You know girl makes a decision in... at sixteen and she's... she has to live through it

74
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:08,438
and the woman becomes the result of that.

75
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:15,694
But unlike my two earlier books, I have character Sue (are) full of self-doubt.

76
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:16,200
mm-hmm

77
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:20,994
Whereas now I have a character who is absolutely confident.

78
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:23,482
And I've never had anybody like that.

79
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,407
I... I'm full of self-doubt.

80
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:29,266
I'm not used to be with somebody who knows what she thinks.

81
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:34,751
She can be totally wrong, things could go horribly astray as they do,

82
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:35,824
but it was f...

83
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:40,682
She's a more of a heroine type of character, that I've ever worked with before.

84
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:44,041
So what did that mean for the writing? Did she tell you what was gonna happen next?

85
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:45,046
They always do.

86
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:45,725
They do?

87
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:50,470
They always do. You just have to stay really close to the heartbeat of the character.

88
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:56,135
It's almost like leaning your head against her chest and hearing... hearing the heartbeat.

89
00:28:56,582 --> 00:29:04,071
Of course in this case it's her story it's a young woman (coming away), but it's against some very big history

90
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:04,457
Right.

91
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:11,195
So it's the kind of things that happened to her are... it's not like what happened to most of... most young people.

92
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:14,695
Uh well, .. we all live in history.

93
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:19,323
You know very few people actually at the top making decisions.

94
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:26,817
Most of us are living where... we see the shadow on the wall, we care a rumor, we read the newpaper and

95
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:30,937
how people live in history realy interests me. And especially now.

96
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,229
Now it's...

97
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:37,161
When I was writing the book it was about the character — now it's me.

98
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:39,863
You know you get a strong sense of what that's like.

99
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:40,268
Yeah.

100
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:46,453
The blurb you're on the cover says: Marina is a female Zhivago.

101
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:53,941
So... I mean you can't read something like... book like this about the Russian Revolution without thinking of these models. Right?

102
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:55,539
Like a doctor Zhivogo.

103
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:58,758
Did  you know... did you have these models in mind?

104
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:04,499
Well. It's all goes into the pot. You know it's a big gumbo.

105
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:07,420
And it's russian literature

106
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:15,947
It's... I mean I encountered Zhivago far earlier than... than Pasternak's novel.

107
00:30:15,953 --> 00:30:19,464
I encountered it on the sc... on the widescreen

108
00:30:19,474 --> 00:30:20,117
Of course. Yeah.

109
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:24,014
In the little train going across the big snowy expanse

110
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:28,326
on the forty foot high faces Zhivago and Lara

111
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:31,710
I mean that brands you forever

112
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:32,156
Yeah.

113
00:30:32,627 --> 00:30:35,207
What about russian literature, russian-write novelists?

114
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:38,532
Uh well I... I fell in love with russian literature.

115
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:41,409
I'm one of those people who is obsessed with russian literature.

116
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:43,738
And I encountered...

117
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,708
I encountered it for the first time as a junior high kid
